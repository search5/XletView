/**
 * <code>ApplicationModeManager</code> provides APIs to avoid the conflict
 * bewteen enhanced bound application and system application. It gives
 * central and general way to solve the conflict between them instead of 
 * calling APIs between themselves one-to-one.
 * <ul>
 * <li>All enhanced bound application which needs full mode, should register
 * {@link ApplicationModeRequestHandler} and respond againt 
 * the request of mode change.</li>
 * <li>All enhanced bound application should call {@link #changeMode(int)}
 * to ask if system application allows, before it really changes</li>
 * <li>All system application which needs negotiation with enhanced bound
 * application, should register {@link ApplicationModeListener}
 * and respond on mode changes.</li>
 * <li>All system application should call {@link #requestModeChange(int)}
 * to ask if enhanced bound application allows, before it really changes</li>
 * </ul>
